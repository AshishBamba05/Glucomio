# Glucomio


Glucomio is a Python-based machine learning model designed to scan genome samples to identify mutations that are potentially correlated with a high risk of Type II diabetes. This project was developed as part of the UCSD Life Science Hackathon in October 2024.

## Project Overview
Glucomio integrates machine learning techniques and genetic analysis to help assess the risk of developing Type II diabetes. The model processes genome samples, identifying specific genetic mutations correlated with increased risk based on known scientific research.

The project also includes an AutoCAD design for a wearable device prototype that recommends food choices for individuals based on their genotype and tracks real-time blood sugar levels for diabetes management.

## Features
Genotype scanning for diabetes risk assessment.
A classification model using KNN (k-Nearest Neighbors) algorithm to predict potential diabetes risk.
Integration of Scikit-Learn for data partitioning and accuracy optimization.
Backpropagation and gradient descent with PyTorch.
AutoCAD prototype design for a wearable device.
